            "certain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein’s manner had started a\n",

            "beneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\n",
            "At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\n",
            "looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\n",
            "exultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\n",
            "the background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\n",
            "spokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\n",
            "“Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.”\n",

            "“Absolutely,” said Dr. Bauerstein.\n",
            "“You mean by that——?”\n",

            "under the circumstances.”\n",
            "John bent his head.\n",
            "“In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.”\n",
            "“Thank you,” said Dr. Wilkins briskly. “We propose that it should take\n",

            "I knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\n",
            "optimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\n",
            "difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\n",
            "other hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\n",
            "felt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\n",

            "“I do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my habit to\n",
            "explain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\n",

            "He did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\n",
            "proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\n",
            "precipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\n",
            "“_Eh voilà une table!_” cried Poirot. “Ah, my friend, one may live in a\n",

            "A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\n",
            "writing-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\n",
            "from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\n",
            "however. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\n",
            "wire through the handle.\n",
            "Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\n",
            "himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\n",
            "opposite leading into Cynthia’s room. That door was also bolted, as I\n",
            "had stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\n",
            "and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\n",
            "against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\n",
            "to rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\n",
            "whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\n",
            "minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\n",
            "On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\n",
            "saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\n",
            "saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\n",
            "near it.\n",
            "I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\n",
            "Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\n",
            "liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\n",
            "“Cocoa—with—I think—rum in it.”\n",
            "He passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\n",
            "been overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\n",
            "and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\n",
            "“Ah, this is curious,” said Poirot.\n",
            "“I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.”\n",
            "“You do not? Observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places; they\n",
            "lie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\n",
            "to powder.”\n",
            "“Well,” I said wearily, “I suppose someone must have stepped on it.”\n",
            "“Exactly,” said Poirot, in an odd voice. “Someone stepped on it.”\n",
            "He rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\n",
            "where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\n",
            "them—a trick of his when he was agitated.\n",
            "“_Mon ami_,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup,\n",
            "grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\n",
            "contained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not\n",
            "contain strychnine!”\n",
            "I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\n",
            "asking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\n",
            "on with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\n",
            "floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\n",
            "very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\n",
            "despatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s\n",
            "hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\n",
            "well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\n",
            "pocket.\n",
            "“I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\n",
            "done—at once!”\n",
            "He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\n",
            "wash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\n",
            "hardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\n",
            "particularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely—even\n",
            "going so far as to smell it.\n",
            "Finally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\n",
            "it up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\n",
            "“We have found in this room,” he said, writing busily, “six points of\n",
            "interest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?”\n",
            "“Oh, you,” I replied hastily.\n",
            "“Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\n",
            "two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\n",
            "floor.”\n",
            "“That may have been done some time ago,” I interrupted.\n",
            "“No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\n",
            "fragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two, but\n",
            "recognizable.”\n",
            "“Ah!” I cried. “That was what you sealed up in the envelope.”\n",
            "“Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s own\n",
            "dresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!” With a\n",
            "dramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\n",

            "eye sweeping the whole length of the wall—“but it was not his candle\n",
            "that made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\n",
            "whereas Monsieur Lawrence’s candle, which is still on the\n",
            "dressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\n",
            "candlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.”\n",
            "“Then,” I said, “what do you deduce?”\n",
            "To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\n",
            "use my own natural faculties.\n",
            "“And the sixth point?” I asked. “I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.”\n",
            "“No,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “I might have included that in the six,\n",
            "but I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\n",
            "present.”\n",
            "He looked quickly round the room. “There is nothing more to be done\n",
            "here, I think, unless”—he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\n",
            "in the grate. “The fire burns—and it destroys. But by chance—there\n",
            "might be—let us see!”\n",
            "Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\n",
            "into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\n",
            "gave a faint exclamation.\n",
            "“The forceps, Hastings!”\n",
            "I quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\n",
            "of half charred paper.\n",
            "“There, _mon ami!_” he cried. “What do you think of that?”\n",
            "I scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:—\n",
            "[Illustration]\n",
            "I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\n",
            "Suddenly an idea struck me.\n",
            "“Poirot!” I cried. “This is a fragment of a will!”\n",
            "“Exactly.”\n",
            "I looked up at him sharply.\n",
            "“You are not surprised?”\n",
            "“No,” he said gravely, “I expected it.”\n",
            "I relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\n",
            "case, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\n",
            "brain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\n",
            "destroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\n",
            "Obviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\n",
            "bolted on the inside.\n",
            "“Now, my friend,” said Poirot briskly, “we will go. I should like to\n",
            "ask a few questions of the parlourmaid—Dorcas, her name is, is it not?”\n",
            "We passed through Alfred Inglethorp’s room, and Poirot delayed long\n",
            "enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\n",
            "went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\n",
            "Inglethorp’s room as before.\n",
            "I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\n",
            "and went myself in search of Dorcas.\n",
            "When I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\n",
            "“Poirot,” I cried, “where are you?”\n",
            "“I am here, my friend.”\n",
            "He had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\n",
            "lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\n",
            "“Admirable!” he murmured. “Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that\n",
            "crescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye. The\n",
            "spacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\n",
            "it not so?”\n",
            "“Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in—Dorcas\n",
            "is here.”\n",
            "“_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the\n",
            "eye.”\n",
            "“Yes, but this affair is more important.”\n",
            "“And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\n",
            "importance?”\n",
            "I shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\n",
            "chose to take that line.\n",
            "“You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\n",
            "interview the brave Dorcas.”\n",
            "Dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\n",
            "and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\n",
            "very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\n",
            "In her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\n",
            "he soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\n",
            "“Pray be seated, mademoiselle.”\n",
            "“Thank you, sir.”\n",
            "“You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?”\n",
            "“Ten years, sir.”\n",
            "“That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\n",
            "to her, were you not?”\n",
            "“She was a very good mistress to me, sir.”\n",
            "“Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\n",
            "you with Mr. Cavendish’s full approval.”\n",
            "“Oh, certainly, sir.”\n",
            "“Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\n",
            "afternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir. But I don’t know that I ought——” Dorcas hesitated.\n",
            "Poirot looked at her keenly.\n",
            "“My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\n",
            "that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\n",
            "your mistress’s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\n",
            "that we should know all—if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\n",
            "back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\n",
            "murderer to justice.”\n",
            "“Amen to that,” said Dorcas fiercely. “And, naming no names, there’s\n",
            "_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\n",
            "was when first _he_ darkened the threshold.”\n",
            "Poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\n",
            "business-like tone, he asked:\n",
            "“Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?”\n",
            "“Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”\n",
            "“What time was that?”\n",
            "“I couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way.\n",
            "Perhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\n",
            "said, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\n",
            "angry in here. I didn’t exactly mean to listen, but—well, there it is.\n",
            "I stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\n",
            "and clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. ‘You have lied to\n",
            "me, and deceived me,’ she said. I didn’t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\n",
            "replied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did—but she answered: ‘How\n",
            "dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\n",
            "everything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\n",
            "upon our name!’ Again I didn’t hear what he said, but she went on:\n",
            "‘Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\n",
            "clearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\n",
            "publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.’ Then I\n",
            "thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.”\n",
            "“You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp’s voice you heard?”\n",
            "“Oh, yes, sir, whose else’s could it be?”\n",
            "“Well, what happened next?”\n",
            "“Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o’clock,\n",
            "Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\n",
            "tea—nothing to eat—to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful—so white\n",
            "and upset. ‘Dorcas,’ she says, ‘I’ve had a great shock.’ ‘I’m sorry for\n",
            "that, m’m,’ I says. ‘You’ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\n",
            "m’m.’ She had something in her hand. I don’t know if it was a letter,\n",
            "or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\n",
            "staring at it, almost as if she couldn’t believe what was written\n",
            "there. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\n",
            "there: ‘These few words—and everything’s changed.’ And then she says to\n",
            "me: ‘Never trust a man, Dorcas, they’re not worth it!’ I hurried off,\n",
            "and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\n",
            "she’d feel better when she’d drunk it. ‘I don’t know what to do,’ she\n",
            "says. ‘Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\n",
            "I’d rather hush it up if I could.’ Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\n",
            "she didn’t say any more.”\n",
            "“She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir.”\n",
            "“What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?”\n",
            "“Well, I don’t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\n",
            "case of hers.”\n",
            "“Is that where she usually kept important papers?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\n",
            "every night.”\n",
            "“When did she lose the key of it?”\n",
            "“She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\n",
            "carefully for it. She was very much put out about it.”\n",
            "“But she had a duplicate key?”\n",
            "“Oh, yes, sir.”\n",
            "Dorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\n",
            "I. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\n",
            "“Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\n",
            "that was lost?” He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\n",
            "the lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\n",
            "Dorcas’s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\n",
            "“That’s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\n",
            "everywhere for it.”\n",
            "“Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\n",
            "to-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\n",
            "dress in her wardrobe?”\n",
            "Dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\n",
            "“No, sir.”\n",
            "“Are you quite sure?”\n",
            "“Oh, yes, sir.”\n",
            "“Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?”\n",
            "Dorcas reflected.\n",
            "“Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.”\n",
            "“Light or dark green?”\n",
            "“A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.”\n",
            "“Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?”\n",
            "“No, sir—not that I know of.”\n",
            "Poirot’s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\n",
            "otherwise. He merely remarked:\n",
            "“Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\n",
            "that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?”\n",
            "“Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn’t.”\n",
            "“Why do you know so positively?”\n",
            "“Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\n",
            "didn’t have any more made up.”\n",
            "“You are quite sure of that?”\n",
            "“Positive, sir.”\n",
            "“Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn’t ask you to\n",
            "sign any paper yesterday?”\n",
            "“To sign a paper? No, sir.”\n",
            "“When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\n",
            "found your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\n",
            "idea to whom these letters were addressed?”\n",
            "“I’m afraid I couldn’t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\n",
            "could tell you, though she’s a careless girl. Never cleared the\n",
            "coffee-cups away last night. That’s what happens when I’m not here to\n",
            "look after things.”\n",
            "Poirot lifted his hand.\n",
            "“Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\n",
            "you. I should like to examine them.”\n",
            "“Very well, sir.”\n",
            "“What time did you go out last evening?”\n",
            "“About six o’clock, sir.”\n",
            "“Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.” He rose and\n",
            "strolled to the window. “I have been admiring these flower beds. How\n",
            "many gardeners are employed here, by the way?”\n",
            "“Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\n",
            "a gentleman’s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\n",
            "A fair sight it was. But now there’s only old Manning, and young\n",
            "William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\n",
            "Ah, these are dreadful times!”\n",
            "“The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\n",
            "will you send Annie to me here?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”\n",
            "“How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?” I asked,\n",
            "in lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. “And about the lost key\n",
            "and the duplicate?”\n",
            "“One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.” He\n",
            "suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\n",
            "powders.\n",
            "“Where did you find it?”\n",
            "“In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp’s bedroom. It was Number\n",
            "Six of my catalogue.”\n",
            "“But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\n",
            "much importance?”\n",
            "“Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\n",
            "about this box?”\n",
            "I examined it closely.\n",
            "“No, I can’t say that I do.”\n",
            "“Look at the label.”\n",
            "I read the label carefully: “‘One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\n",
            "required. Mrs. Inglethorp.’ No, I see nothing unusual.”\n",
            "“Not the fact that there is no chemist’s name?”\n",
            "“Ah!” I exclaimed. “To be sure, that is odd!”\n",
            "“Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\n",

            "“No, I can’t say that I have.”\n",
            "I was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\n",
            "“Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\n",
            "friend.”\n",
            "An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\n",
            "to reply.\n",
            "Annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\n",
            "intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\n",
            "tragedy.\n",
            "Poirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\n",
            "“I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\n",
            "something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\n",
            "were there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?”\n",
            "Annie considered.\n",
            "“There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\n",
            "Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don’t think I remember,\n",
            "sir—oh, yes, one was to Ross’s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\n",
            "one, I don’t remember.”\n",
            "“Think,” urged Poirot.\n",

            "“I’m sorry, sir, but it’s clean gone. I don’t think I can have noticed\n",
            "it.”\n",
            "“It does not matter,” said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\n",
            "disappointment. “Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a\n",
            "saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp’s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\n",
            "that every night?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\n",
            "in the night—whenever she fancied it.”\n",
            "“What was it? Plain cocoa?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\n",
            "teaspoonfuls of rum in it.”\n",
            "“Who took it to her room?”\n",
            "“I did, sir.”\n",
            "“Always?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir.”\n",
            "“At what time?”\n",
            "“When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.”\n",
            "“Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?”\n",
            "“No, sir, you see there’s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\n",
            "to make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\n",
            "used to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\n",
            "take it into her room later.”\n",

            "“About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.”\n",
            "“And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room?”\n",
            "“When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o’clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\n",
            "up to bed before I’d finished.”\n",
            "“Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o’clock, the cocoa was standing\n",
            "on the table in the left wing?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir.” Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\n",
            "now she blurted out unexpectedly:\n",
            "“And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn’t me. I never took the\n",
            "salt near it.”\n",
            "“What makes you think there was salt in it?” asked Poirot.\n",
            "“Seeing it on the tray, sir.”\n",
            "“You saw some salt on the tray?”\n",
            "“Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\n",
            "the tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress’s room I saw\n",
            "it at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\n",
            "asked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\n",
            "out, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\n",
            "had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\n",
            "it in.”\n",
            "I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\n",
            "herself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\n",
            "she would have gaped if she had realized that her “coarse kitchen salt”\n",
            "was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\n",
            "marvelled at Poirot’s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\n",
            "his next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\n",
            "“When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp’s room, was the door leading into\n",
            "Miss Cynthia’s room bolted?”\n",
            "“Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.”\n",
            "“And the door into Mr. Inglethorp’s room? Did you notice if that was\n",
            "bolted too?”\n",
            "Annie hesitated.\n",
            "“I couldn’t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn’t say whether it\n",
            "was bolted or not.”\n",
            "“When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\n",
            "after you?”\n",
            "“No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\n",
            "at night. The door into the passage, that is.”\n",
            "“Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\n",
            "yesterday?”\n",
            "“Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only\n",
            "a reading-lamp.”\n",
            "“Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\n",
            "you think you would have been sure to have seen it?”\n",
            "“Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\n",
            "and a hot iron.”\n",
            "Then Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\n",
            "“Did your mistress ever have a green dress?”\n",
            "“No, sir.”\n",
            "“Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a—how do you call it?—a sports coat?”\n",
            "“Not green, sir.”\n",
            "“Nor anyone else in the house?”\n",

            "“No, sir.”\n",
            "“You are sure of that?”\n",
            "“Quite sure.”\n",
            "“_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.”\n",
            "With a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\n",
            "My pent-up excitement burst forth.\n",

            "“What is a great discovery?”\n",
            "“Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\n",
            "explains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\n",
            "morning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.”\n",
            "“So you think that the cocoa—mark well what I say, Hastings, the\n",
            "_cocoa_—contained strychnine?”\n",
            "“Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?”\n",
            "“It might have been salt,” replied Poirot placidly.\n",
            "I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\n",
            "it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\n",
            "first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\n",
            "it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\n",
            "type of mind.\n",
            "Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\n",
            "“You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_”\n",
            "“My dear Poirot,” I said coldly, “it is not for me to dictate to you.\n",
            "You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.”\n",
            "“A most admirable sentiment,” remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\n",
            "feet. “Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\n",
            "smaller desk in the corner?”\n",
            "“Mr. Inglethorp’s.”\n",
            "“Ah!” He tried the roll top tentatively. “Locked. But perhaps one of\n",
            "Mrs. Inglethorp’s keys would open it.” He tried several, twisting and\n",
            "turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\n",
            "of satisfaction. “_Voilà!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\n",
            "pinch.” He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\n",
            "filed papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\n",
            "approvingly as he relocked the desk: “Decidedly, he is a man of method,\n",
            "this Mr. Inglethorp!”\n",
            "A “man of method” was, in Poirot’s estimation, the highest praise that\n",

            "me. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\n",

            "A wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp’s\n",

            "“Oh, _là là!_ That miserable cocoa!” cried Poirot flippantly.\n",
            "He laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\n",

            "He was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\n",
            "together to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\n",
            "undisturbed as we had left them.\n",
            "Poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\n",
            "very carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\n",
            "“So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray—and poured out. Yes. Then she came\n",
            "across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\n",
            "are the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\n",

            "Everyone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\n",

            "But did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\n",
            "as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\n",
            "her soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\n",
            "slender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\n",

            "hardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\n",
            "great strength of her personality was dominating us all.\n",
            "And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\n",
            "thought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\n",
            "asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\n",

            "Only I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\n",
            "that his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\n",
            "as green as a cat’s. He had heard or seen something that had affected\n",

            "“You will understand, Wells,” he added, “that this is all strictly\n",
            "private. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\n",
            "investigation of any kind.”\n",
            "“Quite so, quite so,” said Mr. Wells soothingly. “I wish we could have\n",
            "spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it’s\n",
            "quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor’s certificate.”\n",

            "“If you know of nothing to the contrary,” pursued Mr. Wells, “I had\n",

            "report. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?”\n",
            "“Yes.”\n",

            "“No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father’s\n",
            "will, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother’s\n",
            "death, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\n",
            "left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\n",

            "“_Hein!_” said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: “Was\n",

            "“I do not know. She may have been.”\n",
            "“She was,” said John unexpectedly. “We were discussing the matter of\n",

            "“Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say ‘her last will.’ Had Mrs.\n",

            "“Come inside, Manning,” said John, “I want to speak to you.”\n",
            "Manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\n",
            "stood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\n",
            "very carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\n",
            "probably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\n",

            "Poirot sharply.\n",
            "“No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”\n",

            "“Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\n",

            "“Not earlier? Couldn’t it have been about half-past three?”\n",
            "“No, I shouldn’t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\n",

            "“In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\n",
            "hurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\n",
            "know. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\n",
            "would have consulted me on the subject—but she had no chance. The will\n",
            "disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\n",
            "I much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\n",
            "you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.”\n",
            "“Suggestive, or not,” interrupted John, “we are most grateful to\n",

            "never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\n",

            "“A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.”\n",
            "John, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\n",
            "moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\n",
            "window as it swept past.\n",

            "I followed John’s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\n",
            "Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\n",
            "of veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\n",
            "of guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\n",
            "earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\n",
            "and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\n",
            "had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\n",
            "had known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\n",
            "had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\n",
            "the man have feared her watchful eyes?\n",
            "I was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\n",
            "painful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\n",
            "that she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\n",
            "eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\n",
            "“Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\n",
            "car. Quickest way to get here.”\n",
            "“Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?” asked John.\n",

            "“My dear Evie, don’t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\n",

            "Howard and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\n",
            "between them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\n",
            "John. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\n",

            "will notice that the word ‘possessed’ is spelt first with one ‘s’ and\n",
            "subsequently with two—correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\n",
            "in a sentence, thus: ‘I am possessed.’ Now, what did that tell me? It\n",

            "afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\n",
            "in my mind, the possibility of a will—(a document almost certain to\n",

            "traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\n",
            "for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\n",

            "“I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\n",

            "on the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\n",

            "were bolted on the inside?”\n",
            "“Well——” I considered. “One must look at it logically.”\n",

            "the destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\n",
            "entered the room. You agree so far?”\n",
            "“Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.”\n",
            "“Well,” I said, encouraged, “as the person who entered did not do so by\n",

            "“There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\n",
            "into the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\n",

            "“Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?”\n",
            "“No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\n",

            "between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?”\n",
            "“I had forgotten that,” I said thoughtfully. “That is as enigmatical as\n",

            "reticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\n",

            "opened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\n",
            "“Oh, Mr. Poirot, I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\n",

            "“Yes, exactly—of course——” The young man hesitated, and then his\n",

            "I hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\n",

            "boudoir. That is so, is it not?”\n",
            "This was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\n",

            "“Will you tell us to whom you sold it?”\n",
            "You could have heard a pin drop.\n",

            "“Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.”\n",
            "The Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\n",
            "“Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\n",
            "where you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?”\n",
            "“Really—I cannot remember.”\n",
            "“That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,” said the Coroner sharply. “Think\n",
            "again.”\n",
            "Inglethorp shook his head.\n",
            "“I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.”\n",
            "“In what direction?”\n",
            "“I really can’t remember.”\n",

            "Inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\n",

            "“I don’t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\n",

            "well-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.”\n",
            "“Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was—a very\n",
            "ridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that,\n",
            "in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don’t at\n",
            "all see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\n",

            "everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\n",
            "that they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\n",
            "Howard’s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?”\n",
            "“Why, she was devoted to her!” I exclaimed.\n",
            "“Tcha! Tcha!” cried Poirot irritably. “You argue like a child. If Miss\n",
            "Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\n",
            "equally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\n",

            "which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\n",
            "present.” He paused a minute, then went on. “Now, to my way of\n",

            "“That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp’s death benefit Miss\n",

            "“Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?”\n",

            "“But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?”\n",

            "“That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\n",

            "“Well,” I said, with a sigh, “we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\n",

            "I’m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn’t know as\n",
            "there was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\n",

            "presence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\n",

            "of being intelligent at all.”\n",

            "“There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.”\n",

            "invaluable.”\n",
            "This was naturally gratifying, but Poirot’s next words were not so\n",
            "welcome.\n",
            "“I must have an ally in the house,” he observed reflectively.\n",
            "“You have me,” I protested.\n",
            "“True, but you are not sufficient.”\n",
            "I was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\n",

            "person. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\n",
            "Still, we can but try.”\n",
            "With a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot’s\n",

            "“Never tell lies,” replied Miss Howard.\n",
            "“It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\n",
            "her husband?”\n",
            "“What do you mean?” she asked sharply. “You needn’t think your pretty\n",
            "explanations influence me in the slightest. I’ll admit that it wasn’t\n",
            "he who bought strychnine at the chemist’s shop. What of that? I dare\n",
            "say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.”\n",
            "“That is arsenic—not strychnine,” said Poirot mildly.\n",
            "“What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\n",
            "just as well as strychnine. If I’m convinced he did it, it doesn’t\n",
            "matter a jot to me _how_ he did it.”\n",
            "“Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,” said Poirot quietly. “I\n",
            "will put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\n",
            "hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?”\n",
            "“Good heavens!” cried Miss Howard. “Haven’t I always told you the man\n",
            "is a villain? Haven’t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\n",
            "Haven’t I always hated him like poison?”\n",
            "“Exactly,” said Poirot. “That bears out my little idea entirely.”\n",
            "“What little idea?”\n",
            "“Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\n",
            "of my friend’s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\n",
            "sentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\n",
            "affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\n",
            "been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\n",
            "criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”\n",
            "“Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\n",
            "nonsense?”\n",
            "“Not at all.”\n",
            "“And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\n",
            "Inglethorp.”\n",
            "“No,” said Poirot curtly. “Because your instinct is not against Mr.\n",
            "Inglethorp.”\n",
            "“What?”\n",
            "“No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\n",

            "“Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\n",
            "It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\n",
            "It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\n",
            "tells you another name——”\n",
            "“No, no, no!” cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. “Don’t\n",
            "say it! Oh, don’t say it! It isn’t true! It can’t be true. I don’t know\n",
            "what put such a wild—such a dreadful—idea into my head!”\n",
            "“I am right, am I not?” asked Poirot.\n",
            "“Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can’t be\n",

            "“Poirot? Does he? How do you know?”\n",
            "I told him of Poirot’s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\n",
            "Bauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\n",
            "“He said twice: ‘That alters everything.’ And I’ve been thinking. You\n",
            "know Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\n",
            "was just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn’t it possible that, as\n",
            "Inglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\n",
            "into the coffee in passing?”\n",
            "“H’m,” said John. “It would have been very risky.”\n",
            "“Yes, but it was possible.”\n",
            "“And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don’t\n",
            "think that will wash.”\n",
            "But I had remembered something else.\n",
            "“You’re quite right. That wasn’t how it was done. Listen.” And I then\n",
            "told him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\n",
            "John interrupted just as I had done.\n",
            "“But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?”\n",
            "“Yes, yes, that’s the point. I didn’t see it either until now. Don’t\n",
            "you understand? Bauerstein had it analysed—that’s just it! If\n",
            "Bauerstein’s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\n",
            "substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\n",
            "tested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\n",
            "dream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\n",
            "sample—except Poirot,” I added, with belated recognition.\n",
            "“Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won’t disguise?”\n",
            "“Well, we’ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\n",
            "He’s admittedly one of the world’s greatest toxicologists——”\n",
            "“One of the world’s greatest what? Say it again.”\n",
            "“He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,” I explained. “Well,\n",
            "my idea is, that perhaps he’s found some way of making strychnine\n",
            "tasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\n",
            "drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.”\n",
            "“H’m, yes, that might be,” said John. “But look here, how could he have\n",
            "got at the cocoa? That wasn’t downstairs?”\n",
            "“No, it wasn’t,” I admitted reluctantly.\n",
            "And then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\n",
            "hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\n",
            "him. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\n",
            "for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\n",
            "Dr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\n",
            "Yet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\n",
            "Cavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\n",
            "poison.\n",
            "And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\n",
            "my arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\n",
            "woman’s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\n",
            "evening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\n",
            "Bauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\n",
            "denunciation that the crime had been committed?\n",
            "Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\n",
            "Evelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\n",
            "possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\n",
            "Yes, it all fitted in.\n",
            "No wonder Miss Howard had suggested “hushing it up.” Now I understood\n",
            "that unfinished sentence of hers: “Emily herself——” And in my heart I\n",
            "agreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\n",
            "unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\n",
            "of Cavendish.\n",
            "“There’s another thing,” said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\n",
            "of his voice made me start guiltily. “Something which makes me doubt if\n",
            "what you say can be true.”\n",
            "“What’s that?” I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\n",
            "of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\n",
            "“Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn’t have\n",
            "done so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\n",
            "heart disease.”\n",
            "“Yes,” I said doubtfully. “But we don’t know. Perhaps he thought it\n",
            "safer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\n",
            "Home Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\n",
            "come out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\n",
            "one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\n",
            "deceived into calling it heart disease.”\n",
            "“Yes, that’s possible,” admitted John. “Still,” he added, “I’m blest if\n",
            "I can see what his motive could have been.”\n",
            "I trembled.\n",
            "“Look here,” I said, “I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\n",
            "this is in confidence.”\n",
            "“Oh, of course—that goes without saying.”\n",
            "We had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\n",
            "into the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\n",
            "the sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\n",
            "Cynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\n",
            "and told her of Poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary.\n",
            "“Of course! I’d love him to see it. He’d better come to tea there one\n",
            "day. I must fix it up with him. He’s such a dear little man! But he\n",
            "_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\n",
            "put it in again, because he said it wasn’t straight.”\n",
            "I laughed.\n",
            "“It’s quite a mania with him.”\n",
            "“Yes, isn’t it?”\n",
            "We were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\n",
            "of Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\n",
            "“Mr. Hastings.”\n",
            "“Yes?”\n",
            "“After tea, I want to talk to you.”\n",
            "Her glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\n",
            "two there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\n",
            "to me to wonder about the girl’s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\n",
            "provisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\n",
            "probably insist on her making her home with them—at any rate until the\n",
            "end of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\n",
            "to let her go.\n",
            "John, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\n",
            "face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\n",
            "“Confound those detectives! I can’t think what they’re after! They’ve\n",
            "been in every room in the house—turning things inside out, and upside\n",
            "down. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\n",
            "being out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!”\n",
            "“Lot of Paul Prys,” grunted Miss Howard.\n",
            "Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\n",
            "Mary Cavendish said nothing.\n",
            "After tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\n",
            "into the woods together.\n",
            "“Well?” I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\n",
            "the leafy screen.\n",
            "With a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\n",
            "sunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\n",
            "to quivering gold.\n",
            "“Mr. Hastings—you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.”\n",
            "It struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\n",
            "girl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\n",
            "“Well?” I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\n",
            "“I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?”\n",
            "“Do?”\n",
            "“Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\n",
            "suppose she forgot, or didn’t think she was likely to die—anyway, I am\n",
            "_not_ provided for! And I don’t know what to do. Do you think I ought\n",
            "to go away from here at once?”\n",
            "“Good heavens, no! They don’t want to part with you, I’m sure.”\n",
            "Cynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\n",
            "Then she said: “Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.”\n",
            "“Hates you?” I cried, astonished.\n",
            "Cynthia nodded.\n",
            "“Yes. I don’t know why, but she can’t bear me; and _he_ can’t, either.”\n",
            "“There I know you’re wrong,” I said warmly. “On the contrary, John is\n",
            "very fond of you.”\n",
            "“Oh, yes—_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\n",
            "Lawrence hates me or not. Still, it’s rather horrid when no one loves\n",
            "you, isn’t it?”\n",
            "“But they do, Cynthia dear,” I said earnestly. “I’m sure you are\n",
            "mistaken. Look, there is John—and Miss Howard——”\n",
            "Cynthia nodded rather gloomily. “Yes, John likes me, I think, and of\n",
            "course Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn’t be unkind to a fly. But\n",
            "Lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\n",
            "bring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\n",
            "her to, but she doesn’t want me, and—and—I don’t know what to do.”\n",
            "Suddenly the poor child burst out crying.\n",
            "I don’t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\n",
            "with the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\n",
            "relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\n",
            "connection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\n",
            "loneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\n",
            "awkwardly:\n",
            "“Marry me, Cynthia.”\n",
            "Unwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\n",
            "up at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\n",
            "“Don’t be silly!”\n",

            "“I’m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\n",
            "my wife.”\n",
            "To my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\n",
            "“funny dear.”\n",
            "“It’s perfectly sweet of you,” she said, “but you know you don’t want\n",
            "to!”\n",
            "“Yes, I do. I’ve got——”\n",
            "“Never mind what you’ve got. You don’t really want to—and I don’t\n",
            "either.”\n",
            "“Well, of course, that settles it,” I said stiffly. “But I don’t see\n",
            "anything to laugh at. There’s nothing funny about a proposal.”\n",
            "“No, indeed,” said Cynthia. “Somebody might accept you next time.\n",
            "Good-bye, you’ve cheered me up _very_ much.”\n",
            "And, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\n",
            "through the trees.\n",
            "Thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\n",
            "unsatisfactory.\n",
            "It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\n",
            "look up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\n",
            "At the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\n",
            "have as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\n",
            "my diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\n",
            "“Apartments” card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\n",
            "tapped on the door.\n",
            "An old woman came and opened it.\n",
            "“Good afternoon,” I said pleasantly. “Is Dr. Bauerstein in?”\n",
            "She stared at me.\n",

            "THE ARREST\n",
            "To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\n",
            "answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\n",
            "I was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\n",
            "it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\n",
            "when he parted from me a few hours earlier?\n",
            "I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\n",
            "was uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\n",
            "all probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\n",
            "resolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\n",
            "arrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\n",
            "myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\n",
            "be a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\n",
            "suspicions of her. She could not be implicated—otherwise I should have\n",
            "heard some hint of it.\n",
            "Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\n",
            "conceal Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest from her. It would be announced in\n",
            "every newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\n",
            "only Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\n",
            "possessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\n",
            "In spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\n",
            "heightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\n",
            "Poirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\n",
            "After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\n",
            "leave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\n",
            "He gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\n",
            "“Great Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn’t believe it at the\n",
            "time.”\n",
            "“No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\n",
            "makes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\n",
            "generally known to-morrow.”\n",
            "John reflected.\n",
            "“Never mind,” he said at last, “we won’t say anything at present. There\n",
            "is no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.”\n",
            "But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\n",
            "eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\n",
            "There was a column of mere padding about “The Styles Poisoning Case,”\n",
            "but nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\n",
            "for some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\n",
            "worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\n",
            "might be further arrests to come.\n",
            "After breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\n",
            "had returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\n",
            "one of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\n",
            "“_Bonjour, mon ami!_”\n",
            "“Poirot,” I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\n",
            "dragged him into the room. “I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\n",
            "I have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?”\n",
            "“My friend,” replied Poirot, “I do not know what you are talking\n",

            "“Dr. Bauerstein’s arrest, of course,” I answered impatiently.\n",

            "“Did you not know it?”\n",
            "“Not the least in the world.” But, pausing a moment, he added: “Still,\n",

            "“The coast?” I asked, puzzled. “What has that got to do with it?”\n",
            "Poirot shrugged his shoulders.\n",
            "“Surely, it is obvious!”\n",
            "“Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\n",

            "Inglethorp.”\n",
            "“Nothing at all, of course,” replied Poirot, smiling. “But we were\n",

            "“Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp——”\n",

            "“Yes.”\n",
            "“Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\n",

            "“Well, no one exactly told me,” I confessed. “But he is arrested.”\n",

            "“But—but I thought you thought so too?”\n",
            "Poirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\n",

            "“Do you mean to say,” I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\n",
            "“that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?”\n",
            "Poirot nodded.\n",
            "“Have you never suspected it?”\n",
            "“It never entered my head.”\n",
            "“It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\n",

            "of walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?”\n",
            "“No,” I confessed, “I never thought of such a thing.”\n",
            "“He is, of course, a German by birth,” said Poirot thoughtfully,\n",
            "“though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\n",
            "him as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\n",
            "years ago. A very clever man—a Jew, of course.”\n",
            "“The blackguard!” I cried indignantly.\n",

            "“Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,” remarked Poirot.\n",

            "other vagaries of the doctor’s passed unobserved.”\n",
            "“Then you think he never really cared for her?” I asked eagerly—rather\n",
            "too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\n",
            "“That, of course, I cannot say, but—shall I tell you my own private\n",

            "Howard. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\n",
            "the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\n",
            "handed to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\n",
            "“On top of the wardrobe.” Then she hurriedly left the room.\n",
            "Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\n",
            "of satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\n",
            "“Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial—J. or L.?”\n",
            "It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\n",
            "lain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\n",
            "Poirot’s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\n",
            "Parkson’s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\n",
            "to “—(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\n",

            "“It might be T., or it might be L.,” I said, after studying the thing\n",
            "for a minute or two. “It certainly isn’t a J.”\n",
            "“Good,” replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. “I, also, am of\n",
            "your way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!”\n",
            "“Where did it come from?” I asked curiously. “Is it important?”\n",
            "“Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\n",
            "existence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\n",

            "“What did she mean by ‘On the top of the wardrobe’?”\n",
            "“She meant,” replied Poirot promptly, “that she found it on top of a\n",

            "“A funny place for a piece of brown paper,” I mused.\n",
            "“Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\n",

            "Dorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\n",
            "“My good Dorcas, I have an idea—a little idea—if it should prove\n",

            "“Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don’t know how you came\n",

            "“You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\n",

            "more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with\n",

            "“Perhaps—because I want to be—free!”\n",
            "And, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\n",

            "“Well, what do you think?” I asked feebly.\n",
