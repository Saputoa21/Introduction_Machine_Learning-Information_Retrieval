            "“Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?”\n",
            "“A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised.\n",

            "today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the\n",

            "light on his murder?”\n",
            "Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head.\n",
            "“I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he\n",
            "had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one\n",
            "distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident—only that I am\n",

            "Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded,\n",
            "satisfied.\n",
            "“And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the\n",

            "commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled.\n",
            "“The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.”\n",
            "The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But\n",
            "the magistrate bethought him of another point.\n",
            "“But surely it is not seven o’clock now?”\n",

            "you suggest any explanation?”\n",
            "“Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot\n",
            "to latch it when he came in.”\n",
            "“Is that a likely thing to happen?”\n",
            "“Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.”\n",
            "There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait\n",
            "in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her.\n",
            "“There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary\n",
            "suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it\n",
            "looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the\n",
            "secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.”\n",
            "The magistrate nodded.\n",
            "“Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by\n",

            "“What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?”\n",
            "asked Poirot.\n",
            "“Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable\n",
            "that they had a motor waiting.”\n",
            "“Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen.\n",
            "“Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the\n",
            "magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite\n",
            "likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.”\n",
            "He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to\n",
            "Mrs. Renauld:\n",
            "“There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of\n",
            "‘Duveen’?”\n",
            "“Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I\n",
            "cannot say I do.”\n",
            "“You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?”\n",
            "“Never.”\n",
            "“Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?”\n",
            "He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any\n",
            "signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite\n",
            "a natural manner. He continued his questions.\n",
            "“Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?”\n",
            "Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied\n",

            "“No, who was that?”\n",
            "“A lady.”\n",
            "“Indeed?”\n",
            "But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed\n",
            "unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and\n",
            "he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary.\n",
            "He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod.\n",

            "we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger.\n",

            "“Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then—she saw the stained point, and\n",
            "she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that—blood?”\n",

            "“Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during\n",
            "the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of\n",

            "“Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.”\n",
            "“What?”\n",
            "“Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on\n",
            "business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be\n",
            "necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was\n",
            "a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him\n",
            "to catch it.”\n",
            "“Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?”\n",
            "“No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my\n",
            "son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.”\n",
            "And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed:\n",
            "“Santiago! Again Santiago!”\n",
            "It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that\n",
            "word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the\n",
            "window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in\n",
            "what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow.\n",
            "“_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.”\n",
            "Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to\n",
            "him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten\n",
            "into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker\n",
            "of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared.\n",

            "“Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is\n",
            "vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to\n",
            "Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so\n",
            "that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused.\n",

            "“_Pauvre femme___,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for\n",
            "her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the\n",
            "place where the crime was committed?”\n",
            "“If you please, M. Bex.”\n",
            "We passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had\n",
            "looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a\n",
            "dissatisfied manner.\n",
            "“It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking\n",
            "of that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken\n",
            "the dead!”\n",
            "“It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by\n",
            "then.”\n",
            "But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting\n",
            "the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at\n",
            "the house.\n",
            "“What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open?\n",
            "It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more\n",
            "probable that they should at once try to force a window.”\n",
            "“But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron\n",
            "shutters,” objected the commissary.\n",
            "Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor.\n",
            "“That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not?\n",
            "And see—there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the\n",
            "world to mount.”\n",
            "“Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so\n",
            "without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.”\n",
            "I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds\n",
            "planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up\n",
            "to the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the\n",
            "back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it\n",
            "without stepping on the bed.\n",
            "“You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no\n",
            "prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the\n",
            "flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.”\n",
            "Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had\n",
            "said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on\n",
            "it anywhere.\n",
            "Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly\n",
            "darted off and began examining the other flower-bed.\n",
            "“M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.”\n",
            "The commissary joined him—and smiled.\n",
            "“My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the\n",
            "gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no\n",
            "importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means\n",
            "of gaining access to the upper story.”\n",
            "“True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these\n",
            "footprints are of no importance?”\n",
            "“Not the least in the world.”\n",
            "Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words:\n",
            "“I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints\n",
            "are the most important things we have seen yet.”\n",
            "M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too\n",
            "courteous to utter his real opinion.\n",
            "“Shall we proceed?” he asked instead.\n",
            "“Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,”\n",
            "said Poirot cheerfully.\n",
            "Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a\n",
            "path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline,\n",
            "round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a\n",
            "kind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from\n",
            "which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and\n",
            "not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a\n",
            "neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M.\n",
            "Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide\n",
            "stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me\n",
            "with astonishment.\n",
            "“Why, this is a golf course,” I cried.\n",
            "Bex nodded.\n",
            "“The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be\n",
            "able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working\n",
            "on them who discovered the body early this morning.”\n",
            "I gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had\n",
            "overlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was\n",
            "the body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I\n",
            "had a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the\n",
            "commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp\n",
            "exclamation of annoyance:\n",
            "“What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one\n",
            "near the place without proper credentials!”\n",
            "The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder.\n",
            "“But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his\n",
            "feet.\n",
            "“My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had\n",
            "arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the\n",
            "utmost impatience.”\n",
            "As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.\n",
            "The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name,\n",
            "and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very\n",
            "tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and\n",
            "moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in\n",
            "his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance.\n",
            "Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of\n",
            "interest came into the detective’s eye.\n",
            "“I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in\n",
            "the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.”\n",
            "“Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently.\n",
            "I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the\n",
            "other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any\n",
            "clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself.\n",
            "“The examining magistrate—” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him\n",
            "rudely:\n",
            "“A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing.\n",
            "For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so.\n",
            "I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very\n",
            "well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the\n",
            "murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who\n",
            "have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better\n",
            "nowadays.”\n",
            "“Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen\n",
            "who discovered the body.”\n",
            "The other grunted disgustedly.\n",
            "“I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the\n",
            "hedge—but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre\n",
            "footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been\n",
            "carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see\n",
            "anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.”\n",
            "“The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?”\n",
            "The other detective stared.\n",
            "“Of course.”\n",
            "A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but\n",
            "checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying.\n",
            "“That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But\n",
            "you’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who\n",
            "used it wore gloves. Here they are.” He gesticulated with his foot to\n",
            "where two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “And they’re\n",
            "Renauld’s too—or at least his gardener’s. I tell you, the men who\n",
            "planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with\n",
            "his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They\n",
            "counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always\n",
            "_something!___ And I mean to find it.”\n",
            "But Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short\n",
            "discoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched\n",
            "it delicately with his finger.\n",
            "“And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I\n",
            "thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question.\n",
            "Giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor\n",
            "cared.\n",
            "“May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn’t interest\n",
            "me.”\n",
            "“I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said Poirot sweetly.\n",
            "I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and,\n",
            "if so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he\n",
            "had no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of\n",
            "the ground.\n",
            "Meanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over\n",
            "the boundary, and tried the door of the little shed.\n",
            "“That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place\n",
            "where the gardener keeps his rubbish. The spade didn’t come from there,\n",
            "but from the toolshed up by the house.”\n",
            "“Marvellous,” murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. “He has been here\n",
            "but half an hour, and he already knows everything! What a man!\n",
            "Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.”\n",
            "Although I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly\n",
            "impressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help\n",
            "feeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and\n",
            "it vexed me. He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of\n",
            "silly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at\n",
            "this juncture, he suddenly asked:\n",
            "“M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that\n",
            "extends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?”\n",
            "“No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there\n",
            "is here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.”\n",
            "“A bunkair?” Poirot turned to me. “That is the irregular hole filled\n",
            "with sand and a bank at one side, is it not?”\n",
            "I concurred.\n",
            "“You do not play the golf, M. Poirot?” inquired Bex.\n",
            "“I? Never! What a game!” He became excited. “Figure to yourself, each\n",
            "hole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged\n",
            "mathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is\n",
            "only one pleasing thing—the how do you call them?—tee boxes! They, at\n",
            "least, are symmetrical.”\n",
            "I could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to\n",
            "Poirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no\n",
            "malice. Then he asked:\n",
            "“But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?”\n",
            "“Yes, he was a keen golfer. It’s mainly owing to him, and to his large\n",
            "subscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a\n",
            "say in the designing of it.”\n",
            "Poirot nodded thoughtfully.\n",
            "Then he remarked:\n",
            "“It was not a very good choice they made—of a spot to bury the body?\n",
            "When the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been\n",
            "discovered.”\n",
            "“Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that _proves___ that they\n",

            "evidence.”\n",
            "“Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body\n",
            "there—unless—unless—they _wanted___ it to be discovered. And that is\n",
            "clearly absurd, is it not?”\n",
            "Giraud did not even trouble to reply.\n",

            "has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the\n",
            "sum totals two hundred thousand francs!”\n",

            "During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork\n",
            "in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in\n",
            "another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the\n",

            "beautiful girl had emerged.\n",
            "“She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his\n",

            "have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made\n",
            "in Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband. One\n",
            "does not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about\n",
            "her, you comprehend.” I nodded, my interest growing.\n",
            "“And—the daughter?” I ventured.\n",
            "“A truly beautiful young girl—modest, devout, all that she should be.\n",
            "One pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who\n",
            "wants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and\n",
            "then—” The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically.\n",
            "“But it would not be her fault!” I cried, with rising indignation.\n",
            "“No. But what will you? A man is particular about his wife’s\n",

            "young goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her\n",
            "cheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with\n",
            "apprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid!\n",
            "“Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, “we\n",
            "regret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law—you\n",
            "comprehend? My compliments to Madame your mother, and will she have the\n",
            "goodness to grant me a few moments’ interview.”\n",
            "For a moment the girl stood motionless. Her left hand was pressed to\n",
            "her side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her\n",
            "heart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice:\n",
            "“I will go and see. Please come inside.”\n",
            "She entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur\n",
            "of her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with\n",
            "a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said:\n",
            "“But certainly. Ask them to enter.”\n",

            "Daubreuil.\n",
            "She was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of\n",
            "her figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike\n",
            "her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna\n",
            "style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was\n",
            "a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to\n",
            "hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost\n",
            "exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive.\n",
            "Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her\n",
            "charm was of the quality which is independent of age.\n",
            "Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and\n",
            "cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and\n",

            "“Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat. “I am investigating the\n",

            "at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?”\n",
            "The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly:\n",

            "“Madame, we are investigating a murder.”\n",
            "“Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.”\n",
            "“Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man\n",

            "“Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?”\n",
            "“Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man\n",

            "“Ah!” she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult\n",

            "me aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of\n",
            "the floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by\n",
            "inch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks. He\n",
            "pounced on a bundle by the door, but it proved to be only a ragged coat\n",
            "and trousers, and he flung it down again with a snarl. Two pairs of old\n",
            "gloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them\n",
            "aside. Then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over\n",
            "one by one. In the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head\n",
            "thoughtfully. He seemed baffled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten\n",
            "my presence.\n",
            "But, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old\n",
            "friend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex,\n",

            "“But this is extraordinary, Mr. Giraud,” cried M. Hautet. “Another\n",

            "“A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.”\n",
            "“And so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “Could it\n",

            "The doctor’s words were so surprising that we were all momentarily\n",
            "taken aback. Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have\n",
            "been stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet Dr. Durand\n",
            "asserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours!\n",

            "importance that he should know at once of the new and startling\n",

            "Evidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he\n",
            "wanted in Paris. The quickness of his return proved that. Very few\n",
            "hours had sufficed. I wondered how he would take the exciting news I\n",
            "had to impart.\n",

            "on the evening of the tragedy.\n",
            "I approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had\n",

            "negatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners—he\n",
